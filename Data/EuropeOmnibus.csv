Fiscal assumptions: Fiscal projections are based on the January 2016 Congressional Budget Office baseline adjusted for the IMF staff?s policy and macroeconomic assumptions. The baseline incorporates the key provisions of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, including a partial rollback of the Sequester spending cuts in fiscal year 2016. In fiscal years 2017 through 2021, the IMF staff assumes that the sequester cuts will continue to be partially replaced, in proportions similar to those already implemented in fiscal years 2014 and 2015, with back-loaded measures generating savings in mandatory programs and additional revenues. Projections also incorporate the Protecting American From Tax Hikes Act of 2015, which extended some existing tax cuts for the short term and some permanently. Finally, Fiscal projections are adjusted to reflect the IMF staff?s forecasts for key macroeconomic and financial variables and different accounting treatment of financial sector support and of defined-benefit pension plans and are converted to a general government basis.
